### For workshop attendees:

There are two ways to access the workshops:

  - Using the RStudio Cloud Workspace **(Our prefered option)**: All
    material is available in the conference workspace:
    <https://bit.ly/2Nnblc2> . This works from your web browser, and you
    do not need R and Rstudio installd on your machine to access it.

  - Using your own machine: You can download zip files of each workshop,
    or if you are familiar with Git and GitHub, you can clone the
    repository. Follow the links in the table above to the relevant
    workshops.

If you are unsure about your setup, or unable to access the material on
your own machine, please use the RStudio Cloud method.

<br>

**To download and use this material on you machine, please use these
steps:**

1.  Make sure you have `R` and RStudio installed.

2.  Identify the sessions you are attending from the list above, and
    follow the link to the relevant repository.

3.  Click the ‘Clone or Download’ button and select ‘Download zip file’:

4.  Once the file has downloaded, unzip it, and open the ‘.Rproj’ file.

### For workshop leaders:

Please commit you workshop material to a GitHub repository by
30/10/2019. This will allow us time to make sure your material is
available on RStudio cloud. Please email a link to your repository, and
a list of the required `R` packages, to
[nhsrconfspeakers@gmail.com](mailto:nhsrconfspeakers@gmail).

If you are using healthcare related datasets as examples, please
consider adding them to the `NHSRdatasets` package. The data can then be
reused by other to learn `R` or when running training. You can find the
package at: <https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRdatasets>
